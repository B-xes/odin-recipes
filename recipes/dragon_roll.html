<h3>How to make a Dragon Roll Step-By-Step</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Rinse rice in a strainer until water runs clear. Combine rinsed rice and water in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over rice; stir until rice cools and looks dry.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Arrange shrimp tempura on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes per side. Cut the tails off of 4 tempura shrimp.</li>
    <li>Cover a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay 1 nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the plastic wrap. Spread 1 cup rice over nori using moistened fingers, leaving a 1/3-inch border. Flip nori so rice is facing the mat.</li>
    <li>Arrange imitation crabmeat and cucumber along the bottom edge of nori. Place 2 tail-off shrimp in the center of nori. Place 2 tail-on shrimp on the end so that the tails extend over the sides of nori. Lift the edge of the mat and roll up nori into a tight log around filling.</li>
    <li>Transfer sushi roll to a serving plate. Layer avocado and unagi slices on top to cover the top and sides of roll. Slice roll into 8 pieces using a moistened knife. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, and unagi to make a second roll.</li>
